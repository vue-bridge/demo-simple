# Simple Example Setup using `@vue-bridge` packages

This is an example library using:

*  `@vue-bridge/runtime`
*  `@vue-bridge/eslint-config`
*  `@vue-bridge/testing`

It builds and tests a Vue library with a few siple components, targeting Vue 3, but written cross-compatible. 

It's source code, including tests, are re-used in `./vue2` to build and test the same source for Vue 2.
